### TS-STARTER

This is a starter project that based on `node 20 lts` and `typescript` with `esm` support.

- [x] `ESM` with `import` and `export`
- [x] `absolute import paths`
- [x] output `esm` with `declaration`

### Notes

- `tsx` seems not supporting watching folders changes, therefore `nodemon` is used.
- `yarn v4.2.2` is used as `packageManager`, feel free to change any other `packageManager` you like.
  - remove `"packageManager": "yarn@4.2.2"` in `package.json`, if you changed to other `packageManager`
